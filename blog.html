            I have visited a lot of places around the world. Traveling is fun to me and its very interesting to me.
            Looking
            to learn more history about countries with their cultures trying
            new things around their culture their past because if you wanna look at the future of somthing look at the
            past.

            Lets start out with my favorite place my homeland Bosnia. I went there so far 4 times in my life 2000 , 2005
            ,
            2008 and 2010. The reason I visit there is too see my Grandmother’s
            and Grandfather’s grave. I see all my family around it and visit my camp. We cook our amazing lamb that we
            put
            lots of salt on it so its really salty. I love visiting my other Grandfather
            and Grandmother's house where we make more awesome food like our beef sausage and our…show more content…
            Another one of my favorite places I have ever visited Is Niagara Falls we went to the both sides of falls
            American and Canadian side we loved the Canadian Side more because it was much cleaner and they took more
            care
            into their side in my opinion. We went on a boat ride on the falls it was
            beautiful they told us all kinds of facts and history about the Falls which was really interesting.

            Another place I have loved visiting was Los Angeles during a delivery trip with my dads commercial truck
            which
            we saw lots of cool stuff during our way down to Los Angeles we saw new cool stuff out in the west new foods
            ,
            new culture we tried out this weird food I have never tried fried
            squirrel which was amazing food I wish they served in New York it kinda tasted like fried chicken. While we
            were
            out on this trip we saw one of tournaments for my favorite video game which was awesome to watch. My
            favorite
            team won during the tournament. After the tourney we delivered our load to the destination and while we were
            coming back
            we got more of our favorite food fried squirrel. We loved go out to Los Angeles its our favorite place to
            deliver a load
            to because you find so much stuff out to west and instead of the south which is much interesting to look
            for.

            After those trips a year after them we went go see Italy vs Bosnia in Italy which was very fun match to
            watch 2 really
            good teams going at each other we were seeing the city of Rome which was beautiful city.
